# What to Wear App

## Description
This is the first stage of developing an app that will identify your location and relevant weather information to provide a list of recommended clothing choices. Secondarily, there will be an option that allows new garments to be added and assigned to weather conditions.

Initially, the latitude and longitude are fixed, and all garments are static.


## Technologies used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
